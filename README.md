# POV-Display
3D imaging system with the ability to visually project a three dimensional copy of an object which can be used for various technical, educational and bio medical applications. The projected image can be rotated by means of gesture control using human hand.

# Overveiw
By utilising Persistence of Vision (POV) of human eye, we designed a POV disaplay that can project any image and make it seem like a hologram for the human eye. Future implementation that was planned for this project was to incorporate a gesture controllable feed for controlling the images that is rendered through the POV disaplay.

# How it works
We will be creating matrices of the images that we want to display using 'polar.py'. Sample files which we generated can be foung in cache folder.
'init.py' is used to testout the neopixels for the POV display to render rainbow, maze and other effects.
'final.py' utilises the image matrices created pre-hand for rendering the images through neopixels.

Note: HW used includes raspberry pi 3b+, neopixels, DC motor, acrylic frames for the propeller. This project was done during 2019 for an event in our university.
